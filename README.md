# pdfgenerator
I built this to be an endpoint to enable easy pdf generation for multiple use cases. You can create as many different layouts as you want in the views folder, and use CSS3, so CSS grid and flexbox will all work here. No more using HTML2 and CSS 2 and building with tables as with most PDF generators out there.

The index.html is an example file which you can customize depending on which data you need, this will ultimately depend on what kind of PDF you need to create.
A button on the front end or back end of a cms can target the http request function on a click event. Again this will probably need customising depending on what you want to do with it.
